One of CHARM-EU’s core values is inclusiveness. They strongly believe in the power of diversity. Learning and growing in a diverse environment leads to the personal development and cultural enrichment of all students. They understand that diversity can take many forms, and they are aware of the potential sensitivity of disclosing the nature of the circumstances.
Many structural barriers inequalities persist for students when accessing and participating in higher education. Financial support is strongly correlated with postsecondary completion, and it, even more, applies to underrepresented groups.
The grant aims to minimise barriers that hinder the access and participation of students who meet all the admission requirements and cannot access other grants and scholarships.  
However, please bear in mind that in line with the capacity and resources of the CHARM-EU, the grant is limited to 5% of the total students enrolled in the edition of the Master. For that reason, they encourage you to check other grants and opportunities.

Description
Atlas Shrugged is a mystery novel like no other. You enter a world where scientists, entrepreneurs, artists, and inventors are inexplicably vanishing—where the world is crumbling.
And what you discover, by the end, is an uplifting vision of life, an inspiring cast of heroes, and a challenging new way to think about life’s most important issues.
Students who participate will need to read the book they have selected carefully, grapple with its complex themes, and push the boundaries of their writing ability. By doing so, we hope students will achieve a deeper appreciation for Rand’s literary works and develop a curiosity for the philosophy that underlies them.

Description
Clarendon scholarships are normally offered for the full period of fee liability. This is the period for which you are liable to pay course fees to the University. The fee liability page explains this in full, and also gives information about charges that may be applied after this period, known as continuation charges, which are not covered by the Clarendon Fund.
In some cases the academic division has the discretion to extend your scholarship to cover an additional period of study where the course is known to require additional time. The extension period applies to living expenses only and not to any continuation charges. Scholars will be notified in their offer letter if an extension to funding is provided.

Pinsky Law supports, and provides its services to, entrepreneurs and startup companies. This is the reason they developed and maintain the legal resources for startups section on this website.
They know that establishing and operating a new venture is challenging and requires commitment of substantial financial resources. Founders of a new venture must be personally and financially committed to their startup business.
Many entrepreneurs mortgage their homes, cash RRSP, and use credit cards to finance the initial operations of the new venture. Access to these sources of capital may be critical to the startup, but these resources come at a high emotional and financial cost.

Description
Bertha Lamme was born on her family’s farm near Springfield, OH in 1893.  After she graduated from Olive Branch High School in 1889, she followed in her brother’s footsteps and enrolled at Ohio State. She graduated in 1893 with a degree in Mechanical Engineering with a specialty in Electricity.  Her thesis was titled “An Analysis of Tests of a Westinghouse Railway Generator.”
In 1893, Bertha Lamme became the country’s first female engineer when she took a job at Westinghouse Electric Corporation.  She joined her brother, who was a rising star at Westinghouse.  Bertha spent 12 years with Westinghouse and would have worked on some bigger transportation system projects.  Her brother was notable for designing the giant generators at Niagara Falls.
As progressive as Westinghouse was at the time for employing a woman, it was still standard for ladies to retire when they married. When Bertha wed a fellow engineer, she left the company.  Bertha marred Russell Feicht in 1905, and they had one child, Florence, born in 1910, who became a physicist for the US Bureau of Mines.

Description
UEA Music Centre awards a number of Music Centre Awards every year, to new and current students who show exceptional musical achievement and commitment.
The awards are for musicians of any instrument or voice and any style or tradition – including different national traditions. They are intended to encourage recipients to develop their musical and leadership skills and contribute significantly to music at UEA. A high standard of performance is expected, but equally important is a clear commitment to take leading roles in the musical life of the University.
Application is after entry to UEA, generally the second week of the autumn semester.
The awards are made for one year, but if the holder wishes to continue and can demonstrate to the Director of Music that they have made significant contributions during that year, they are welcome to re-audition for the next year and the award may be renewed. If at any point the Director of Music has concerns, the holder of an award may be invited to discuss their involvement in musical life. If it is felt that the holder is not willing or able to make the required contribution, the award may be withdrawn.

The awards are worth £800 per year. Where the Director of Music considers that a candidate has not met the required standard but shows promise, a smaller sum may be awarded to support their development towards a main award in a subsequent year. The award holder is expected to use the money to develop their musical skills and resource. Instrumental or vocal lessons can be arranged as part of this expectation.

No qualifications need to have been taken. A high standard of performance can be demonstrated at audition. In the case of a musician performing in a style or tradition without a formal method of assessment this is particularly important.
For those used to the graded exam system it may be useful to say that a performing standard of Grade 8 and above is a benchmark. Neither Grade 8 nor any other exam need either have been taken or passed.
If you currently have a UEA Music Scholarship you are not eligible for a UEA Music Centre Award.

The Care-Experienced Academic Futures scholarships will offer financial support to students who have experienced being in care in the UK to pursue graduate study at Oxford.
The pilot will include the inaugural award of the Oxford-Rees Graduate Scholarship, which supports care-experienced Social Sciences candidates.
For the purposes of selection, ‘care experienced’ means having been looked after by the state or your local authority, or as a looked-after child.
This could include:
living with foster carers under local authority care;
living in a residential children's home;
being 'looked after at home’ under a supervision order; or
living with friends or relatives in kinship care – either through a formal arrangement (such as a Special Guardianship order) or an informal arrangement, without local authority support.
You do not have to meet the legal definition of being a care leaver to be considered for this scholarship.

Description
The Crankstart Scholarships (formerly known as Moritz-Heyman Scholarships) provide a programme of enhanced support for UK residents from lower-income households to undertake undergraduate study at Oxford.
This is possible thanks to a generous donation by Sir Michael Moritz and Ms Harriet Heyman. The Crankstart Graduate Scholarships continue this support to graduate level, both for taught and research courses.
The aim of these scholarships, therefore, is to support Crankstart scholars’ progression from their undergraduate courses to taught postgraduate courses, which will prepare them for doctoral study at Oxford.

Your essay is a very important part of your application. Your essay should be thoughtful and original, it should express your views in your own voice, and it should fully answer the question asked. To develop your ideas for your essay, discuss the question with a professor, faculty advisor, or University Writing Center tutor. Take time to plan, draft, revise, and proofread your essay. The University Writing Center can help you with the writing process.
The letter of recommendation also carries a lot of weight in the selection process. The better your recommender knows you, the stronger a recommendation they will be able to write. Meet with your recommendation writer and tell them (or remind them) about your accomplishments and goals. Give your recommender ample time to write their recommendation, at least three weeks if possible. ","Eastern Michigan University

Description
This new scholarship programme will increase the number of women from low and middle-income countries who are able to take up offers to study science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) subjects at postgraduate level at Oxford. The programme, which will provide support for 30 taught master’s students over a period of five years, has been made possible by a generous donation from the Optiver Foundation.
The first Optiver Foundation Scholars will begin their studies at Oxford in October 2023. Scholars will join the Departments of Statistics, Computer Science, Physics, Chemistry and Engineering Science, or the Mathematical Institute, and will receive full financial support to cover their course fees, as well as a a grant for living costs. The donation will also enable the provision of tailored induction activities, mentoring and on-course support for the scholars.
Thanks to the generosity of the Optiver Foundation, Oxford will also develop and pilot a new way of assessing the socio-economic background of international applicants. This will ensure that the funding provided through the new Optiver Foundation Scholarship Programme is finely targeted at eligible offer-holders who are most in need of financial support. Key findings from this pilot will be used to inform future scholarship programme development at the University.

To qualify for any graduate scholarships you must be unconditionally admitted to a master's or doctoral degree program and be registered in enough units in your graduate degree program.
UVic Graduate Awards of up to $10,000 per academic year require a minimum GPA of 6.0/9.0 or higher (as of 2022-2023) and a minimum of 1.50 units per term.
Graduate Awards allow for part time registration in a minimum of 1.5 units each term.
Graduate donor awards, those funded by private donors, require full time registration in a minimum of 3.0 units unless the specific terms of the scholarship indicate that it may be issued to a part time student, or a student who has completed their graduate program. See the list of all donor awards and their terms.
Graduate students registered with the Centre for Accessible Learning (CAL) are considered to be full time when registered in 1.5 units, and are eligible to be considered for all UVic graduate scholarships when registered in 1.5 or more units. Students must identify themselves to FGS and send a copy of their CAL letter to scholoff@uvic.ca.
To maintain eligibility and avoid delays in scholarship payments, register at least two-to-three weeks, or more, in advance of each term in the required number of units.

Description
Lydia I Pickup was born in Fort Dix, New Jersey while her father was in the Army, but she claimed West Virginia as her early home. She graduated from Parkersburg, West Virginia high school in 1939. In 1942, following the US entry into World War II, she enlisted in the US Navy and went to the first WAVE boot camp in Cedar Falls, Iowa. She went to Link Trainer instructor school in Atlanta and served as an instructor in Jacksonville, Florida.  After the war, using the GI Bill, she attended the University of Wisconsin majoring in Electrical Engineering but was called back into the service just before completing the degree.
In 1947, she joined the Naval Reserve and after the start of Korean War, she was posted to Seattle. When released in 1953, she remained in Seattle and went to work for Boeing Airplane Company. Lydia had a 30-year career with Boeing with her primary focus on change management and configuration control. She worked on many planes and related systems from the B-52 to SRAM missiles and various phases of the Saturn program’s use for manned missions to the moon.  She was transferred for various times in the 60’s to New Orleans, Louisiana and Huntsville, Alabama. She retired from the Navy as a Chief Petty Officer in 1964.

The Dr. Andrew and Kay Montana Endowed Scholarship in Chemistry was established in 2021 in memory of the late Dr. Andrew (Andy) Montana, former faculty member and Chair of the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, who passed away in 2007.
Dr. Montana was one of the university’s early faculty members and played a major role in shaping how science, in general, and chemistry, in particular, are taught on campus.
He played a pivotal role in the development of the Science Laboratory Center (later renamed Dan Black Hall) and was instrumental in the design, oversight and development of the building.
He retired from CSUF in 1992 after 29 years of service. His wife Kay Montana, who passed away in 2020, once said that “Andy loved hiking and fishing and just being outdoors. Only his love of Cal State Fullerton and his students kept him there all those years.”

She is one of the women engineering students at the Drexel Institute of Technology, now Drexel University, who in November 1946 “organized a society to promote friendship and to help each other with problems.” In the early days when she was a senior and chairman of the SWE group, she had to go to Dr. James Creese, President of the Institute, to get money to sponsor activities such as the 1949 first SWE conference.
In 1949, Alma Kuppinger Forman became the first woman at the Drexel Institute of Technology to receive a degree in Civil engineering. She is a registered Professional Engineer in Pennsylvania.

Description
The Alcorn Family Ceramics Scholarship was established in 2013 by Trish and Gary Alcorn. Gary Alcorn’s passion for the arts began early in life and was encouraged by his mother, Madelyn Alcorn. They shared a particular interest in ceramics and one of Gary’s fondest memories of his mother was her love of slip casting. Many years later, as a building service worker in the clay studios, Gary observed the enthusiasm displayed by the students and was impressed by their high level of dedication. With the encouragement and guidance of the ceramics students, Gary soon learned to work with clay and throw on the potter’s wheel. Gary’s interest in giving back to support these committed students led to the establishment of The Alcorn Family Ceramics Scholarship.

Description
Ron Scott was a Professor of Chemistry for 38 years, prior to his untimely passing in 1997.  He was appreciated by students, faculty, and staff for the breadth of his knowledge in several areas of chemistry (biochemistry, physical chemistry, toxicology, dietetics, and neurochemistry, his ability to speak extemporaneously on virtually any subject, his seemingly endless supply of free energy, his knowledge of Detroit geography and history, and his gift for telling a good tale.  His greeting was famous, even on the bleakest day, ""The sun is shining.  The birds are singing.""
Professor Scott loved Detroit, EMU, and teaching EMU students.  He was very active in outreach to high schools in the Detroit area.  The winner of several faculty teaching and scholarship awards, Professor Scott provided the stimulus for the creation of EMU's nursing program, outlined plans for the toxicology program, and at the time of his death, was seeking approval for an industrial hygiene program.  He was also an active participant in general education reform.  A prolific writer, Professor Scott published 38 papers, 10 books, and two laboratory manuals during his EMU tenure.

Martin Gorski (1895-1968) was born near Kraków, Poland. He emigrated to the U.S. in 1912, enlisted in the U.S. Army, and returned to Europe to fight in WWI. After the war, he returned to the U.S., settled in Detroit, Michigan in the 1920s, and was employed by the Ford Motor Company.
Antoinette Gorski (née: Lenart) (1906-1982) was born in Zakopane, which is located in southern Poland near the border with Slovakia. She emigrated to the U.S. in 1919, following her mother to New Jersey and then to Michigan. She met Martin and they were married in 1923. They had three daughters: Helen, Frances, and Rose. Frances met James J. Hylko, also of Detroit. They were married in 1949 and had two children, Linda F. (b. 1958) and James M. (b. 1961).
The endowed scholarship was established by James M. Hylko in memory of his grandparents. James graduated from Eastern Michigan University with a bachelor's degree in biochemistry in 1984, and has been involved in nuclear-related activities throughout his career.

Description
The Robert Small Scholarship Award was established in 1975 and recognizes outstanding art historical writing by a student in the Wonsook Kim School of Art. This memorial scholarship was started with gifts from Dr. Small’s colleagues, family, and friends. Small earned a PhD from the University of Iowa, an MA from St. Lawrence University, and a BA from Tufts University. Dr. Small was an assistant professor of art history at Illinois State University from 1969 to 1974. He was a leader in developing the Department of Art’s original art history curriculum and established the first collection of slides to aid students and faculty in their research. Professor Small’s original slide collection, which was contained with a single shoebox, grew to include more than 100,000 slides. The Robert Small Slide Library in the Center for the Visual Arts was named in his honor.

Description
Judith Lamer Bole Roepke was born in Winnipeg Manitoba Canada in 1934, the first child of Janet (Macaulay) and Elswood Frederick Bole. Her sister, Nancy Richards (Bole) Cullen, was born six years later and they grew up in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, enjoying summers at the Lake of the Woods in Ontario.
After completion of her MS in Health Education with a minor in Public Health Education, Judith was invited to teach a nutrition course for the then called department of Home Economics at Ball State and soon realized she wanted to do that the rest of her life. This led her to Purdue University to pursue a PhD in Nutrition, which she earned in 1977.
The Judith Ropeke Scholarship for Dietetics was established to provide scholarships to Ball State University students.
