Description
One of CHARM-EU’s core values is inclusiveness. They strongly believe in the power of diversity. Learning and growing in a diverse environment leads to the personal development and cultural enrichment of all students. They understand that diversity can take many forms, and they are aware of the potential sensitivity of disclosing the nature of the circumstances.
Many structural barriers inequalities persist for students when accessing and participating in higher education. Financial support is strongly correlated with postsecondary completion, and it, even more, applies to underrepresented groups.
The grant aims to minimise barriers that hinder the access and participation of students who meet all the admission requirements and cannot access other grants and scholarships.  
However, please bear in mind that in line with the capacity and resources of the CHARM-EU, the grant is limited to 5% of the total students enrolled in the edition of the Master. For that reason, they encourage you to check other grants and opportunities.

The Province allocates OGS awards to universities specifying the number of awards that each may offer to their students annually.
Applicable programmes

University of Toronto
Toronto, Canada
Chemistry and Biochemistry
University of Windsor
Windsor, Canada

The value of the OGS is $5,000 per session. Thus, awardees may receive $10,000 for two consecutive sessions or $15,000 for three consecutive sessions.
In all instances, the awarding graduate unit will contribute to one-third the cost of the total award received by the students.
Each scholarship is tenable for one year (i.e., two consecutive or three academic sessions). The value and duration of each OGS award will be determined by the awarding graduate unit and detailed in the offer letter.

Description
UEA Music Centre awards a number of Music Centre Awards every year, to new and current students who show exceptional musical achievement and commitment.
The awards are for musicians of any instrument or voice and any style or tradition – including different national traditions. They are intended to encourage recipients to develop their musical and leadership skills and contribute significantly to music at UEA. A high standard of performance is expected, but equally important is a clear commitment to take leading roles in the musical life of the University.
Application is after entry to UEA, generally the second week of the autumn semester.
The awards are made for one year, but if the holder wishes to continue and can demonstrate to the Director of Music that they have made significant contributions during that year, they are welcome to re-audition for the next year and the award may be renewed. If at any point the Director of Music has concerns, the holder of an award may be invited to discuss their involvement in musical life. If it is felt that the holder is not willing or able to make the required contribution, the award may be withdrawn.

Benefits
The awards are worth £800 per year. Where the Director of Music considers that a candidate has not met the required standard but shows promise, a smaller sum may be awarded to support their development towards a main award in a subsequent year. The award holder is expected to use the money to develop their musical skills and resource. Instrumental or vocal lessons can be arranged as part of this expectation.

No qualifications need to have been taken. A high standard of performance can be demonstrated at audition. In the case of a musician performing in a style or tradition without a formal method of assessment this is particularly important.
For those used to the graded exam system it may be useful to say that a performing standard of Grade 8 and above is a benchmark. Neither Grade 8 nor any other exam need either have been taken or passed.
If you currently have a UEA Music Scholarship you are not eligible for a UEA Music Centre Award.

The scholarship is applied on a pro-rata basis, apportioned to each course taken in each term of study.
The scholarship benefit will be applied as tuition fee waivers directly to the recipient's University student account.
This will reduce the tuition fee liability by the scholarship benefit amount for each term of the program of study, provided the conditions of the scholarship are maintained. The benefit amount will be calculated on the number of units the recipient is enrolled in at Census date for each term. The tuition fee waiver may not be reflected on the tuition fee account until census date has passed. After census date, a fee waiver will be applied to the recipient’s student account.
